## The Graveyard project

For the class of HIST3000, we were promtped to investigate and record a cemetery in our community. The information here will concerns the Holy Trinity Bukovyan Chapel and Cemetery in Ottawa. 

# The preparation of the project

Before visiting the site, we were tasked and advised to create a quick sketch map of the graveyard using Google Earth and any basic drawing software like paint.
This would allow us to easily navigate the cemetery, and choose which graves to explore.
